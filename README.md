# Advent of Code 2023

## These saucers are flyin', baby!

This year I'm claiming a deduction on my taxes and doing the challenges in [BQN](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/index.html). I have been very excited to try this language and I hope I do not fail miserably in rising to the challenge.

Everything's the same as last year. I'm changing the naming conventions of the files a little bit to make things less confusing. Files named `69.bqn` and `69.in` are the solution and input text respectively of the 69th day of the advent calendar. If a second part adds supplementary input text it'll be named `69.1.in` or something like that.
